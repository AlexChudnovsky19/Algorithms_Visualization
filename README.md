Overview
This project is an interactive algorithm visualization tool built using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C++.
The primary goal of this project is to provide a visual representation of various algorithms, allowing users to better understand their inner workings and dynamics through real-time animation.
